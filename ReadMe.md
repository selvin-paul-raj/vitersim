### Simplify Your Vite React Project Setup

**Vitersim** is a lightweight CLI tool that automates the cleanup and simplification of a new Vite React project. By deleting unnecessary files, clearing up the `index.css`, and rewriting `App.jsx` or `App.tsx` to a minimal component, **Vitersim** allows developers to start with a clean, streamlined environment.

## Features

- **Automated Cleanup**: Deletes `App.css`, the `assets` folder, and clears `index.css`.
- **Streamlined Structure**: Rewrites `App.jsx` or `App.tsx` to a minimal "Hello World" component.
- **Instant CLI Execution**: Run directly with `npx vitersim`—no manual setup required.
- **Improves Project Readiness**: Helps developers get right to coding without manual file adjustments.

## Installation and Usage

You can use **Vitersim** without installing it globally by using `npx`:

```bash
npx vitersim
```

Or install it locally within your project:

```bash
npm install vitersim --save-dev
```

Then, add a script in your `package.json` to run Vitersim:

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "vitersim"
}
```

Run the script with:

```bash
npm run clean
```

## How It Works

**Vitersim** performs the following actions in a Vite React project:
1. **Deletes `app.css`**: Removes any default styles.
2. **Deletes the `assets` folder**: Clears unnecessary assets.
3. **Rewrites `App.jsx` or `App.tsx`**: Updates the component to a simple "Hello World" starter.
4. **Clears `index.css`**: Empties the main stylesheet to start fresh.

## Project Requirements

Ensure your project has the following structure for **Vitersim** to function properly:

```plaintext
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx (or App.tsx)
│   ├── app.css
│   ├── assets/
│   └── index.css
└── ...
```

## Example Output

After running `vitersim`, your `App.jsx` (or `App.tsx`) will be reset to:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello World!
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Technical Details

Vitersim uses Node.js's `fs` and `path` modules to interact with the file system. It follows an asynchronous, modular approach to ensure non-blocking operations and robust error handling.

## Compatibility

| Dependency | Version      |
|------------|--------------|
| Node.js    | >= 14.0.0    |
| Vite       | 3.x and above |
| React      | 17.x and above |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check that:
1. The file and folder names match (`app.css`, `assets`, `App.jsx` or `App.tsx`, and `index.css`).
2. You have sufficient file permissions in your project directory.
